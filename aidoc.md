Yes, that's a good approach. Let me create a documentation summary of the key aspects from the codebase:

# FST File System Documentation

## 1. File Formats
- **XDF**: Original format (legacy)
- **RSF** (Random Segment Files): New backend format
  - Based on sparse files
  - No size limits (exabyte realm)
  - Supports concatenation
  - Parallel write capability
  - Container functionality

## 2. Interfaces

### Modern Interface (fst24)

```44:50:librmn/src/fst/README.md
## New interface: fst24

* In the `fst24` interface, Standard Files are manipulated trough three derived types (or structs, in C)
   * `fst_file` is an opaque handle to a file, and allows for file operations like opening, searching, reading and writing.
   * `fst_record` encapsulates all attributes of a record, as well as its data. It represents an item that is written to or read from a file.
   * `fst_query` represents a search through a file. It contains the search criteria as well as the current position of the search within the file.
* Datatypes are specified through 2 parameters: type (real, integer, etc.) and size (in number of bits). This avoids the need to specify size separately before a read/write operation.
```


Three main types:
1. `fst_file`: File handle for operations
2. `fst_record`: Record container with metadata and data
3. `fst_query`: Search interface

### Legacy Interface (fst98)
- Still supported
- Can use RSF backend through:
  - Opening option: `'RND+RSF'`
  - Environment variable: `FST_OPTIONS="BACKEND=RSF"`

## 3. Key Features

### Record Operations
- Reading: Direct access via keys
- Writing: New rewrite modes (FST_YES, FST_NO, FST_SKIP)
- Searching: Multiple concurrent queries supported
- Metadata handling: Extended metadata support

### Thread Safety

```124:140:librmn/src/fst/README.md
## Thread Safety

The `fst24` interface is entirely threadsafe when accessing RSF files, but has some threading limitations when XDF files are involved.

### What is safe

- Opening several files concurrently
- Any concurrent access to different files
- **RSF only**: Any concurrent access to the same file
    - *Note*: When opening the same file with multiple threads, the same rules as for parallel write must be followed. If the file is
      open in read-only mode, it will simply be considered as several different files by the API.

### Limitations for XDF files

- When opening the same file concurrently, *it has to be in read-only mode*.
- Searching a single file cannot be done by multiple threads simultaneously

```


### Python Interface
- Modern API available
- Supports both XDF and RSF backends
- Iterator pattern for record access

## 4. Implementation Details

### RSF Structure
- Segment-based file organization
- Thread-safe operations
- Parallel write support
- Extended metadata capabilities

### Data Types and Packing
- Multiple data types (real, integer, complex)
- Compression options (including turbopack)
- Configurable bit depths (8, 16, 32, 64)

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect? This documentation will help me better assist with your Python project questions.
